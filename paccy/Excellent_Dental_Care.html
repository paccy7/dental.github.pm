    <p><img id="img-pic2" src="picture\pic6.jpeg" alt="town"></br>Dental Consultation<br>
        Dental consultations are the beginning of your journey at Excellent_Dental_Care.Dental consultations are a great way to discuss your fears and concerns regarding an upcoming dental procedure with your dentist. Most dental consultations don‚Äôt involve those sharp pointy objects that dentists insert inside your mouth during a regular appointment. So, what is a dental consultation all about, and what should you expect to happen?

        A dental consultation is an appointment with your dentist, where you discuss your dental problems, settle on a treatment plan, and clear out any doubts or questions. Your dentist might also conduct a non-invasive oral examination to assess your oral condition and suggest treatment plans accordingly.</p>
    <p>
        <p> <img id="img-pic2" src="picture\fill.jpg" alt="town"></br>Teeth_Filling<br>
            A dental filling is a dental procedure used to restore part of a tooth that has been damaged by decay.<br> The objective with a filling is to remove the decayed area, clean it well,<br> and ‚Äúfill‚Äù the space with a material, returning the tooth to its normal shape and, hopefully, normal function.</p>
        <p>
            <p><img id="img-pic2" src="picture\IMG-20230414-WA0010.jpg" alt="town"> Teeth_Cleaning<br>
                Everyone wants straight and well aligned teeth. Let us mold you the perfect aligner to help release your lovely smile.</p>
                <p><img id="img-pic2" src="picture\teeth.jpg" alt="town"> Teeth_whitening<br>
                    Teeth whitening refers to a variety of processes that aim to make someone‚Äôs natural teeth appear brighter and whiter. <br>Teeth whitening methods include sanding down stains, bleaching, ultraviolet (UV) light therapy, and more.

                    Many different teeth whitening products are available, and you can try many approaches at home. You can also get your teeth whitened at your dentist‚Äôs office.

                    Some teeth whitening methods can cause uncomfortable side effects, particularly tooth sensitivity and gum irritation. Let‚Äôs take a look at how teeth whitening works, how to do it safely, and what you should know about its side effects.</p>
                    <p><img id="img-pic2" src="picture\dentx.jpg" alt="town"> Dental_X-Ray<br>
                        Dental X-rays (radiographs) are images of your teeth that your dentist uses to evaluate your oral health.<br> These X-rays are used with low levels of radiation to capture images of the interior of your teeth and gums.

                        These X-rays can help your dentist to identify problems like cavities, tooth decay, and impacted teeth. Dental X-rays may seem complex, <br>but they‚Äôre actually very common tools that are just as important as your teeth cleanings.</p>
                        <p><img id="img-pic2" src="picture\impl.jpg" alt="town"> Dental_Prothesis<br>
                            A dental prosthesis is a dental appliance that replaces a missing tooth or covers up tooth defects.<br> These dental appliances include implants, crowns, bridges, dentures and veneers, and some of them can be removable or permanently fixed in your mouth.</p>
                            <p><img id="img-pic2" src="picture\ext.jpg" alt="town"> Dental_Extractions<br>
                                A dental extraction (also referred to as tooth extraction, exodontia, exodontics, or informally, tooth pulling<br>) is the removal of teeth from the dental alveolus (socket) in the alveolar bone.</p>
                                <p><img id="img-pic2" src="picture\prev.jpg" alt="town"> Preventive_Dentistry<br>
                                    Preventive dentistry is the practice of caring for your teeth to keep them healthy. <br>This helps to avoid cavities, gum disease, enamel wear, and more.

                                    There are many forms of preventive dentistry, such as daily brushing and dental cleanings.<br> To maintain optimal oral health, the American Dental Association (ADA) recommends visits to the dentist at regular intervals determined by a dentist. These practices are designed to ensure that teeth are clean, strong, and white. Children should be taught proper oral hygiene at an early age.

                                        Pediatric dentists are dedicated to the oral health of children from infancy through the teen years. <br>They have the experience and qualifications to care for a child‚Äôs teeth, gums, and mouth throughout the various stages of childhood.</p>
